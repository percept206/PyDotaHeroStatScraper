# PyDotaHeroStatScraper
Grabs the stats of any of the 119 DotA Heros by scraping dotagamepedia.com allows you to level your characters and retrieve stats according to their formulas. You can choose to save the stats as a text file if you want. 

The Hero Name must be formatted with how it would be spelled in a URL, so Night Stalker should be input as Night_Stalker Shadow Fiend as Shadow_Fiend etc.
